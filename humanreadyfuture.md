As an engineer and tech geek i am convinced of the opportunities created by new technology. But I am also worried about the risks that arise, if technology is not used with good intentions. Just think of Orwell's 1984, look at the history where tech was used in a bad way or today where it's more relevant than ever. Most recent examples are the political power of social networks or biased facial recognition algorithms.

I think and write about the interaction between technology, society and a code of ethics for the development of new technologies.
