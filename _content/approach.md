I am inspired by the future and what could be. Approaching challenges with a creative, open mind-set yet staying focused I spot the relevant patterns to set the right priorities and define the strategy to develop and launch great products. Achieving the project goals and releasing a product on to the streets makes me happy and motivates me during realization. I improve and learn with every project and get inspiration from different cultures and everything I find out there. To stay balanced while being busy I shred the trails with my bike, enjoy great design and get an energy push out of music and a good coffee.
