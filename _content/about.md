My curiosity to understand how things work and the believe that the future will be better with the help of technology drive my passion for new technologies.
I am a graduated electrical engineer with roots in hardware development. Over the time I extended my skills to software development, product and business to a holistic view of tech products.
At the intersection of user/stakeholder needs, technology and business I can put my experience, talents and enthusiasm best at work to create and launch new products that make a difference in everyday life.
I believe that technology alone doesn't fix things. Products can only be truly great when they support the users, the society and its ethical values. <a href="/humanreadyfuture/">#humanreadyfuture</a>
