Building viable and innovative tech products is my passion. It is driven by my enthusiasm for technology and the desire to create useful and great things. As a graduated electrical engineer with roots in hardware and software development, I extended my skills to business and holistic product strategy/management. Based on my experience, skills and strength (Futuristic, Strategic, Focus, Learner, Achiever), I strive at the intersection of customer/stakeholder needs, technology and business. Thinking about future scenarios and spotting relevant patterns and trends to ideate new solutions makes the time fly for me. 

My professional focus is to work on a 21st-century solution for getting from A to B. I am fascinated by the possibilities of automated driving and digitalization for future mobility. With 7+ years of experience in various roles, I am an expert in automated driving and its technology. My knowledge ranges from perception sensors, system design, software development, automotive standards to deep customer and industry insights. Experienced in working in agile frameworks and managing complex projects in volatile conditions, I approach challenges with resilience, curiosity and an open mindset continuously learning and improving.

But my interest doesn't end here. The potential generated by big data inspires me to tinker on some side-projects. Keeping my python skills fresh and creating useful and entertaining results out of data.

Speaking of automated driving and data, I think and occasionally write about the influence of new technologies on society, emerging ethical questions and how to maintain a human-ready future.

Besides all the tech I shred the trails or gravel roads, enjoy great design, or just relax with a good cup of coffee.

That's a short intro about myself. I’d love to connect and chat more with you. Whether it’s about product, tech ethics, or anything else.
