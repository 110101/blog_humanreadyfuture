I am Etlam, a digital strategist/product manager. My passion is to create new products that make a difference for people. With my background in engineering, I focus on solving problems with the help of technology.

I am enthusiastic about autonomous driving as one key to the future of mobility because getting from A to B is a basic need that requires a 21st-century solution.

While convinced that technology creates numerous opportunities, I believe that a too technocratic approach can lead to social challenges. It must be the goal to find the right balance to achieve a human-ready future.
