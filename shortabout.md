I'm Malte, a tech product strategist/product manager. My passion is to to create new products with the help of technology. Especially enthusiastic about the future of mobility, because getting from A to B is a basic need which requires a 21st century solution. While believing in the power of technology to lead to a better, brighter future there is also a flip side.
