I am thinking about sustainability <a href="/assets/content/LeanCanvas_EI.pdf" target="_blank">Download sustainability lean business canvas</a> and thereby changing business models lately. In times where a sustainable economy is more necessary than ever before to fight the climate crisis.
I thought it would might help to make an adaption of the classic and famous lean business canvas by Alex Osterwalder / Strategyzer. It is just a small change, but sometimes the little changes can have a big impact.

I added a single extra box to the lean business canvas to make the environmental impact of the needed key resources transparent. This will lead to different costs and therefore it spans into the cost structure box as well. By visualizing the environmental footprint it can help to shape your concept to a sustainable business.
